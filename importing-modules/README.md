# Importing custom and node module

- Created date-main.js file that imports the     http node module and date-module.js
    - it creates a http server and prints the current date and time on the localhost server at port 8000
- Created date-module.js file that returns the current date and time
    - This module has a function called         getCurrentDateTime() that returns the     date
    - this function is then added to module.exports
